**Lane Detection using Hough Transfom**

This project implements lane detection using the Hough Transform from scratch, part of an assignment for a Computer Vision course.

Steps

Convert to Grayscale: Convert the input image to grayscale.

Apply Median Filter : Reduce noise for better edge detection.

Defining Region of Interest 

Edge Detection: Use Canny Edge Detection to highlight lane edges.

Hough Transform: Identify lines by detecting collinear points.

Applying maximum filter and non-maximum suppression 

Lane Detection: Filter and display lane lines on the original image.
