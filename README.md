#Lane Detection using Hough Transform

This project implements lane detection using the Hough Transform from scratch, part of an assignment for a Computer Vision course.

Steps

Convert to Grayscale: Convert the input image to grayscale.

Apply Gaussian Blur: Reduce noise for better edge detection.

Edge Detection: Use Canny Edge Detection to highlight lane edges.

Hough Transform: Identify lines by detecting collinear points.

Lane Detection: Filter and display lane lines on the original image.
